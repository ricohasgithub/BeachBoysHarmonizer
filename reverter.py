Reverter.py

This file contains the method revert_wav_file that converts from .png files (mel spectrograms) via librosa's
Short-Term Fourier Transformations (STFT) graphing algorithms to audio (.wav files).

# This method takes in the path to the assets folder containing the source converted directory (containing the spectrogram file and associated csv file to be processed). It transforms the csv file into a .wav audio file under filename
def convert_mel_file(assets_path, filename):

    # Assets_path is only the path to the assets; apply pathing to the source folder and the save folder
    input_path = assets_path + "/output/" + filename
    pd_arr_path = input_path + "/" + filename + ".csv"

    

    # librosa.feature.inverse.mel_to_audio()
